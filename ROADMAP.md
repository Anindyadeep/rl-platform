### Phase 0:

- **Day1** 
    - @Pratyush-exe : Implement Street Fighter and Extend Open AI Car to multi-agent 
    - @Anindyadeep : CartPole, Lunar Lander, Bi-pedal, extract code, get step function, delete the reward and make a function that will take a custom reward function. Check `examples/example.py`

- **Day2**
    - Input: Different paramters (Reward function, neural network hyper params, RL hyper param)
    - Track the reward function and save it to a local 
    - Transfer model from one computer to another using a local network 
    - Transfer of big files from one computer to another (may be usinng google drive)
    - W&B integration 

- **Day3**
    - Authentication 
    - Peer to Peer Tournament implementation (optional)
    - Private and Public leaderboard 
    - API implementation using FastAPI 
    - Petals (Optional)
    - Encryption and decryption of locally stored models and metrics (after auth -> .pt file with a header of auth token)

- **Day4**
    - Platform implementation (web/.exe/sdk) 
        - sdk if not time available 
        - web/.exe if time available
    
    - Deploy the whole thing with documentation and test 


Give people that independence such that even 3 people start out to read RL then they can compete with each other locally
without having other dependencies.
