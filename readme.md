**Some important pointers**

1. Evaluation criteria for participants will be 
    - Submission time 
    - Number of submissions of participants
    - What algo it is using 
    - was the submission done during the hackathon 
    - Total rewards 
    - Number of episodes and epochs the participants used to train 

    we need to make our own metric so that we can calculate our own final metric for evaluation

2. Some open source tools that we can use to speed up our whole project. 
    - [Streamlit Leaderboard](https://github.com/yairf11/streamlit-leaderboard)
    - [RayLab](https://github.com/0xangelo/raylab)

Even Hugging face has also similar kind of platforms out there. But our main USP will be 

    - Agents can fight with each other and can steal the score
